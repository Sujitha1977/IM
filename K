Algorithm / Procedure:

1. Step 1: Define the main problem clearly.
E.g., "Customers are receiving their products late."


2. Step 2: Ask "Why?" this problem occurs. Note the answer.


3. Step 3: Take the answer from Step 2 and ask "Why?" again.


4. Step 4: Repeat the process for 5 levels of Why, or until you reach the root cause.


5. Step 5: Analyze the final reason and brainstorm UX design solutions based on user needs.
