Here is the complete lab answer for Question 14 from your Big Data Analytics Practical Exam:

ðŸ§¾ Question 14: Write a HIVE DML command.

ðŸ§ª Aim: To understand and execute Hive Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands such as LOAD, INSERT, and SELECT, which are used to manage and manipulate data within Hive tables.

ðŸ§  Algorithm:

1. Open Hive CLI or Beeline.


2. Create a table to store sample data.


3. Use the LOAD command to load external data from HDFS into the table.


4. Use the INSERT command to add new records.


5. Use the SELECT command to retrieve data from the table.


6. Use DELETE (Hive 0.14+) or overwrite with NULL to simulate deletion.


7. Use TRUNCATE to remove all records from a table.


8. Exit Hive CLI.



ðŸ’» Program (Hive DML Commands):

Step 1: Create a table

CREATE TABLE employee (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  department STRING,
  salary FLOAT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

Step 2: Load data from a file in HDFS Assume the file employee.txt contains: 101,John,IT,50000
102,Alice,HR,55000
103,Bob,Finance,60000

Command:

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/warehouse/employee.txt' INTO TABLE employee;

Step 3: Insert new data into the table

INSERT INTO TABLE employee VALUES (104, 'David', 'Sales', 48000);

Step 4: Select and display data

SELECT * FROM employee;

Step 5: (Optional) Truncate table

TRUNCATE TABLE employee;

ðŸ“¤ Output:

After SELECT: | id  | name  | department | salary | |-----|-------|------------|--------| | 101 | John  | IT         | 50000  | | 102 | Alice | HR         | 55000  | | 103 | Bob   | Finance    | 60000  | | 104 | David | Sales      | 48000  |

âœ… Result: The Hive DML commands were successfully executed to load, insert, retrieve, and truncate data in the Hive table.
